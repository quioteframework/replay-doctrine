/**
 * A `Doctrine\DBAL\Driver\Middleware` (DBAL 4's own extension seam, installed
 * via `Doctrine\DBAL\Configuration::setMiddlewares([$middleware])` passed to
 * `Doctrine\DBAL\DriverManager::getConnection($params, $config)`) that
 * appends one {@see \Quiote\Replay\Cassette\EffectKind::Db} entry per query
 * to an injected {@see EffectLedger}.
 *
 * Structured after DBAL's own `Doctrine\DBAL\Logging\Middleware` (a
 * Driver/Connection/Statement decorator chain built on the abstract
 * middleware base classes DBAL ships for exactly this purpose), not a raw
 * reimplementation of the `Driver`/`Connection`/`Statement` interfaces.
 *
 * A failing query (bad SQL, a constraint violation, ...) is never recorded:
 * the real exception propagates unchanged and no ledger entry is written for
 * it, matching every other recorder in this package -- a failed call has no
 * result to replay, and no entry is a more honest state than a fabricated
 * one.
 *
 * Wiring this into an application's own Doctrine connection (deciding WHEN to
 * record, redaction, sampling, ...) is `RecorderMiddleware`/plugin territory
 * and is out of scope here; this class only has to work correctly when
 * installed.
